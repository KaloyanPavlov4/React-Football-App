## Roadmap

### High priority
The API has a call limit of 10 per minute, which is not enough for the site to work properly.
- [ ] Backend that periodically calls the api and saves the data that the website can later call as much as needed

### Medium priority
- [ ] Implement cup details

### Low priority
- [ ] Add posibility to "star" a team and then be able to easily check their upcoming matches and team details more easily

### Dependencies

* React
* MUI
* MUI Icons
* Date fns
* Playwright
